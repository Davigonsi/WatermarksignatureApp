# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. File Preview Rendering Issues
**Problem:** Canvas was not initializing properly, causing files (especially PDFs) to not display correctly.

**Solution:**
- Fixed canvas initialization race conditions in `Editor.js`
- Ensured proper cleanup and disposal of existing canvas before re-initialization
- Added proper callback handling for background image loading
- Fixed PDF rendering to wait for canvas to be fully initialized before setting state

### 2. Watermark and Signature Placement/Movement Issues
**Problem:** Watermarks and signatures could not be dragged or moved on the canvas.

**Solution:**
- Ensured all fabric.js objects have proper interaction properties:
  - `selectable: true`
  - `evented: true`
  - `hasControls: true`
  - `hasBorders: true`
- Added proper event listeners for object interaction:
  - `object:moving`
  - `object:scaling`
  - `object:rotating`
  - `object:modified`
  - `selection:created`
  - `selection:updated`
- Fixed CSS to ensure canvas has `pointer-events: auto !important`
- Added proper cursor styles for better UX

### 3. PDF Page Navigation Clearing Watermarks
**Problem:** When navigating between PDF pages, applied watermarks and signatures were lost.

**Solution:**
- Implemented object serialization/deserialization when changing pages
- Save watermark and signature objects with their properties before page change
- Restore objects after new page is rendered
- Used `fabric.util.enlivenObjects()` to properly recreate objects with all properties

### 4. API Communication Issues
**Problem:** Client couldn't communicate with backend server properly.

**Solution:**
- Added `setupProxy.js` to proxy API requests from client (port 3000) to server (port 5000)
- Added `http-proxy-middleware` dependency to client package.json
- Configured proxy to handle `/api` routes

## Files Modified

1. **client/src/components/Editor.js**
   - Fixed canvas initialization logic
   - Enhanced object interaction configuration
   - Implemented PDF page navigation with object preservation

2. **client/src/components/Editor.css**
   - Added proper pointer-events and cursor styles
   - Ensured canvas interaction is not blocked

3. **client/package.json**
   - Added `http-proxy-middleware` dependency

4. **client/src/setupProxy.js** (NEW)
   - Created proxy configuration for API communication

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the Backend Server:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```
   Server will run on http://localhost:5000

2. **Start the Frontend Client:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```
   Client will run on http://localhost:3000

3. **Test the Following:**
   - Upload an image file (PNG, JPG, etc.)
   - Apply a text watermark - verify you can drag and resize it
   - Apply a signature - verify you can drag and resize it
   - Upload a PDF file
   - Apply watermark and signature
   - Navigate between PDF pages - verify watermarks/signatures persist
   - Process and download the file

## Key Improvements

- ✅ File previews now render correctly for both images and PDFs
- ✅ Watermarks can be dragged, resized, and rotated
- ✅ Signatures can be dragged, resized, and rotated
- ✅ PDF page navigation preserves applied watermarks and signatures
- ✅ Proper API communication between client and server
- ✅ Better error handling and console logging for debugging

## Notes

- All processing is done client-side using fabric.js and pdf-lib
- No data is sent to external servers
- Files are processed locally in the browser
- The application is ready for local testing and debugging
